                Extreme levels of such processes as intense rainfall, flooding, droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires can have devastating effects. As changes in climate, land cover, and river regulation influence these processes, society and insurers need to understand how their extreme levels are evolving beyond their historical distribution. Classical extreme value theory provides the foundation for modeling block maxima or exceedances over high thresholds in the case of stationarity, and time variation can be introduced pragmatically in different ways. We review the approaches for modeling time-varying extremes. Among these approaches, state‑space models offer considerable flexibility  but are seldom used due to their computational complexity. We show how recent advances in approximate filters and smoothers can be used to avoid full posterior reconstruction by recursively updating the conditional mean and variance of the latent states.  An application to real data shows how the method captures seasonal and trending patterns, highlighting its usefulness for modeling and forecasting extremes.

                There are numerous applications which involve modelling multi-dimensional count data, notably in actuarial science and risk management. When such data exhibit an excess of zeros, common count models, such as the Poisson model, are no longer suitable. With multivariate data, characterizing an appropriate dependence structure is equally critical in order to adequately assess the underlying risk inherent in the joint counts. In this talk, I will present a new bivariate zero-inflated Poisson model appropriate for modelling pairs of counts with a surplus of zeros. The proposed construction is based on a mixture model involving a common mass at zero along with a Poisson random pair. Various forms of dependence are considered for the latent Poisson pair, allowing for both negative and positive dependence. In this talk, the general formulation and corresponding model properties will be presented. Various estimation techniques will be discussed and further explored through both simulations and data illustrations.

                Optimal exit from Uniswap v3 and best expected return for a liquidity provider

            <td class="abstract">
                We analyze the profitability of liquidity providers' (LPs) positions in Uniswap v3 by aggregating fee income and impermanent loss within an optimal stopping framework. Our first result shows that the liquidity burn should be optimized over one range at a time, rather than simultaneously. Second, without discounting future fees, there is no finite optimal liquidity burn time and indefinite liquidity provision is optimal. In this case, we derive closed-form expressions for the value of LP positions according to different price levels of liquidity burn. Third, with a discount factor, we introduce an equivalent rate of return and demonstrate that under a Black-Scholes model with volatility sigma, the optimal return is approximately \(0.425\sigma^2\) (i.e. about 10% return for 50% volatility), and it is achieved by choosing the at-the-money range of liquidity. These results provide explicit formulas and strategic insights for LPs in Uniswap v3, and complement recent works on Uniswap v2 and fee modelling by highlighting the distinct impact of concentrated liquidity.

                Optimal Loss Reporting: Time Since Last Claim
            </td>

            <td class="abstract">
                We study a continuous-time loss-reporting problem for a fully insured individual  under a two-class Bonus-Malus system that incorporates the realistic feature of time since the last reported claim. If no claim has been reported over the past \(n\) years, the insured belongs to Class 1 and pays a premium at rate \(\pi_1>0\). Upon reporting a claim, the insured moves to Class 2, where a higher premium rate \(\pi_2>\pi_1\) applies and the clock is reset to zero. While in Class 2, the insured returns to Class 1 if no claim is reported for \(n\) consecutive years; otherwise, if another claim is reported before \(n\) years elapse, the clock is again reset and the insured remains in Class 2.<br>

                The insured adopts a barrier strategy for loss reporting and seeks to maximize the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth over a random horizon \(\tau\). We derive the optimal barrier strategy in semi-explicit form, showing that it depends on both the current rate class and the elapsed time since the last reported claim. We further provide qualitative insights into the optimal strategy and the associated value functions.

                Semi-parametric modeling of risk exposure with monotonicity constraints in automobile insurance

                Generalized additive models (GAM) and generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS) allow the inclusion of smoothing functions in the modeling of model parameters. This allows for a much more flexible structure between an explanatory variable and a response variable since linearity is no longer imposed as in the case of a generalized linear model (GLM). This type of model makes it easier to analyze the relationship between variables. However, when working with data associated with a practical context, such flexibility is not always desirable, since certain form constraints may be necessary. In the case of car insurance data, risk exposure should always be an increasing function, since the greater the risk exposure, the higher the probability of an accident, and this increase should be reflected in the premium. In this work, shape constraints to model risk exposure measured by mileage have been included in GAM and GAMLSS models. We use data from a Canadian company to illustrate the proposed approaches. We discuss the relevance of mileage as a measure of risk exposure and how the measure should be included in the modeling.

                Mortality modeling plays a central role in actuarial science, with applications ranging from life insurance valuation to optimal lifetime financial planning. Traditional approaches, such as mortality laws and factor-based models, often fall short in capturing the complexity and heterogeneity of mortality dynamics. This paper introduces a novel modeling framework based on the concept of vitality and its stochastic evolution over the life course. The framework consists of four components that account for initial health conditions, natural aging trends, stochastic fluctuations, and sudden accidental events. We explore how modeling mortality through vitality can replicate a wide class of existing mortality models and capture diverse features such as mortality plateaus and longevity trends. Through multiple applications, including optimal consumption planning and disability modeling, we show that the vitality-based framework is capable of providing tractable solutions and intuitive insights to a broad range of mortality-related problems. A numerical illustration using real-world mortality data further demonstrates the framework's estimation procedure and modeling outcomes.

                Fairness and transparency in predictive modeling shift from ethical aspiration to legal obligation. Explicability tools are the interface between model developers defending their model and reviewers assessing its safety and compliance. However, these tools can be misused and misread when their assumptions go unexamined. Confounding bias is central in causal inference and is largely unaddressed in feature attribution. We start from the Shapley values and build on the recent literature on prediction decomposition. We study how three choices (target, value function, and allocation rule) interact or are equivalent to assuming a specific causal graph on the features. We introduce unconfoundedness as a desideratum for feature allocation and give graph-based conditions under which it holds for classical decompositions. We illustrate the findings in the context of fair insurance pricing.

                Regression trees trained under mean squared error loss can be represented exactly as least-squares fits of linear models, where the covariates are binary indicators corresponding to the tree's internal splits. In this talk, we extend the latter result to trees trained to minimize deviance and explore their relationship to generalized linear models, connecting the algorithmic nature of trees to the parametric structure of GLMs. Motivated by the connection, we develop a hybrid modelling framework where trees or random forests are used to construct features, and the final model is a GLM (based on Poisson, Gamma, or Tweedie distributions) with offsets to account for exposures. We show how this approach can be applied in non-life insurance to improve predictive accuracy while preserving explainability and auditability. The refitted GLM supports regularization, including grouped penalties aligned with the tree structure, and provides feature significance and local interpretability through the split basis. This framework handles constraints relevant to insurance pricing, such as monotonicity in the covariates and fairness constraints. We end this talk by discussing the implications for ratemaking, showing how the approach leads to a convenient method for fitting, regularization, and explanation in modern insurance modelling.

                There is increasing pressure on the financial services industry to disclose the sensitivity of their profitability and stress-test their solvency to various climate scenarios. However, it remains a challenge for actuaries and financial risk managers to fully model and integrate climate-related risks into their operations. This may in turn impact the resilience of the industry and the viability of mitigation and adaptation policies. In this presentation, we discuss the modelling of climate-related physical risk, that is, the financial uncertainty that stems from the frequency and severity of extreme precipitation or extreme heat. We present a consistent modelling framework that leverages statistical and climate models with three different applications: (1) fluvial floods in gauged and ungauged locations across Canada; (2) tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin (covering Canada, U.S. and Mexico), and; (3) mortality of Quebec pensioners due to heat waves. We then show projections of the latter three beyond 2025 based upon various emissions scenarios. We conclude the presentation with insurance and policy implications, and challenges ahead for governments and industry.
